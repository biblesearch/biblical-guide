- Provide a clear, single-paragraph answer to the question based solely on biblical texts, summarizing the Bibleâ€™s stance or overall message.
- Include a brief explanation citing the specific books, chapters, and verses that support your conclusion. If the Bible does not give a clear answer, explain this and mention relevant related verses.
- Address apparent contradictions with context and biblical cross-references to resolve or clarify them.
- Always keep the tone respectful, simple, and accessible for someone who has not read the Bible.
